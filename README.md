# ATM-System

A C program that simulates an ATM using the console and FILE. Requires FILE txt file input containing account number, name, and account balance and stores text input into a struct for each account. Users will use menus in order to decide what actions to take such as creating an account, viewing account info, and withdrawing and depositing money from/to accounts.
